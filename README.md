This Python script demonstrates a backtest of a simple moving average (SMA) crossover strategy using the backtesting library. The strategy buys when a short-term SMA crosses above a long-term SMA and sells when the opposite occurs. It uses historical price data of Google (GOOG) stock for the analysis, applying a commission fee.
#To Run This Program Run this command in Command Prompt 
pip install backtesting
pip install backtesting is used to install the backtesting library, which is a Python package for backtesting trading strategies.

Here's a breakdown of the command:

pip: pip is the package installer for Python. It's a command-line tool that allows you to easily install, update, and manage packages (libraries) for your Python projects.
install: This is the command to install a package.

When you run pip install backtesting, pip will:

Check if the backtesting package is already installed. If it is, pip will skip the installation.
If the package is not installed, pip will download the package from the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository.
Install the package and its dependencies (if any) in your Python environment.
Once the installation is complete, you can import the backtesting library in your Python script or code and use its functions and classes to backtest your trading strategies.

Some reasons why you might need to install backtesting using pip:

You're using a new Python environment or virtual environment, and you need to install the package from scratch.
You've updated your Python version, and the package is not compatible with the new version.
You're working on a new project, and you need to install the package for the first time.
You've uninstalled the package previously, and you need to reinstall it.
By running pip install backtesting, you ensure that you have the latest version of the backtesting library installed, which is essential for using its features and functions in your Python code.
