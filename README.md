This Python script demonstrates a backtest of a simple moving average (SMA) crossover strategy using the backtesting library. The strategy buys when a short-term SMA crosses above a long-term SMA and sells when the opposite occurs. It uses historical price data of Google (GOOG) stock for the analysis, applying a commission fee.
